.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm morseplayer
.Nd play morse code
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm morseplayer
.Op Fl c Ar character-rate
.Op Fl d Ar device
.Op Fl f Ar frequency
.Op Fl w Ar words-per-minute
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm morseplayer
utility reads from its standard input and plays corresponding Morse code
sounds from an audio device.
The program has the full character set for the ARRL/FCC Element 2
examination: A-Z, 0-9,
.Ql \&. ,
.Ql \&, ,
.Ql \&? ,
.Ql / ,
.Ql AR ,
.Ql SK ,
and
.Ql BT .
The prosigns
.Ql AR ,
.Ql SK ,
.Ql AS ,
and
.Ql BT
are represented by
.Ql + ,
.Ql * ,
.Ql | ,
and
.Ql = ,
respectively.
Carriage returns, newlines and spaces are all treated as interword spaces.
Characters unknown to the program are ignored.
.Pp
This program generates the timing of
.So dits
.Sc ,
.So dahs
.Sc ,
intra-element spacing,
character spacing, and
word spacing as specified by the ARRL by default.
For speeds less than 18 words per minute,
the character rate is 18 words per minute, but the overall speed
is set to the default of 5 words per minute or the value specified
by the
.Ar wpm
argument.
For speeds 18 words per minute or higher, the character rate and
overall rate are set to the specified value.
The character rate can also be specified on the command line independently
of the overall rate.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width XXXXXXXXXXX
.It Fl c Ar cwpm
use
.Cm Ar cwpm
as the character rate; default is 18.
.It Fl d Ar device
use
.Ar device
for audio output instead of the default:
.Pa /dev/audio
.It Fl f Ar freq
use
.Ar freq
for the wave frequency instead of the default: 720.0Hz
.It Fl w Ar wpm
use
.Cm Ar wpm
words per minute output; default is 5.
